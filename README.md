##  Overview

**Inner-Balance** is an intelligent digital mental health assessment platform designed to transform the pre-consultation stage of psychological evaluation.  
It bridges the gap between standardized screening tools and personalized clinical interviews using **AI-powered adaptive questioning** grounded in medical evidence.

The platform combines **Next.js** for an elegant, interactive frontend and **Django + AI/ML pipelines** for backend intelligence — featuring a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture integrated with a medical LLM.

##  Problem Statement

### Inefficiencies and Barriers in Pre-Consultation Mental Health Assessment

The pre-consultation phase of mental healthcare is hindered by systemic and patient-centric challenges:

- **Information Asymmetry & Articulation Difficulty:**  
  Patients struggle to express complex emotions accurately, leading to incomplete or biased self-reports.

- **Lack of Personalization:**  
  Current static tools (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) fail to adapt to each individual’s psychological context or cultural background.

- **Data-Poor Clinical Onboarding:**  
  Clinicians often begin sessions with minimal structured data, wasting valuable therapeutic time on redundant information gathering.

- **Latency in Risk Detection:**  
  Static assessments often miss subtle warning signs that may indicate critical mental health risks.

- **Technological Limitations:**  
  Most existing digital tools lack clinical reasoning, interoperability with healthcare systems, and evidence-based intelligence.

---

##  Proposed Solution

### InnerBalance — An Adaptive, AI-Powered Clinical Assessment Framework

InnerBalance introduces a **two-stage adaptive assessment protocol**, supported by a **RAG-enhanced clinical reasoning engine** that ensures safe, context-aware, and evidence-based questioning.

#### 1. Two-Stage Adaptive Assessment
- **Stage 1 – Standardized Screening:**  
  Patients complete a short set of validated clinical questions to establish a baseline.

- **Stage 2 – AI-Powered Personalization:**  
  The system dynamically generates follow-up questions using LLM reasoning, probing deeper into symptoms and risk indicators.

#### 2. RAG-Enhanced Clinical Intelligence
- **Knowledge Grounding:**  
  A medical knowledge base (DSM-5, NICE, WHO mhGAP) stored in **ChromaDB** ensures factual and clinical grounding.  
- **Context-Aware Reasoning:**  
  A specialized **medical LLM (Meditron-7B)** retrieves contextually relevant knowledge for adaptive questioning.  
- **Safe Generation:**  
  The LLM operates under constrained prompts, ensuring **ethical**, **evidence-based**, and **safety-compliant** outputs.

#### 3. Clinical Output
- Comprehensive, structured report integrating symptom summary, risk factors, and insights.  
- Seamlessly integrable with **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** and clinical workflows.
